# CSC690-Final-Project

For this project, I will be creating a translator app from Japanese to English or vice versa. While this app seems pretty standard, I want to include more practical ways to practice Japanese compared to the usual apps. 

Some features that are a must have are:
- Basic translating from English to Japanese or vice versa
- Notecards that the user can make to help study
- Quiz quetions to help the user study

Some nice to have features are:
- Videos from popular Japanese tutorials that the user can access
- Guess an anime from their opening song

There might be more features depending on how the actual implementation of the project goes but so far this is what is planned out.

Completed Version:
- Fully functioning translation interface
- Basic flashcards for the user to study with
- Basic quiz questions for the user to study with

Sadly I was unable to implement the nice to have features or the audio quiz features due to time constraint.
